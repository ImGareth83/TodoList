### Reflections

- what did i like about this project?
\
I like the challenge of this project because i had to put my skills into developing mysql database, spring boot server, and simple webpage
\
&nbsp;
- what did i struggle with in this project?
\
I wished i had more time to work on the project with Thymeleaf. To some extent, i did spend quite abit of time on unit-testing the Controller layer
\
&nbsp;
- what would you make your experience with this assessment better?
\
&nbsp;
I think this assessment is very realistic and there is no need to make it better. The reason being is the closely mirror a real technical interview.
